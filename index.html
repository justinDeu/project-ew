                        <p>
                            Originally from Collegeville, Pennsylvania, I currently study architecture at Virginia Tech. 
                            As a third year architecture student, I am utilizing my focused studies on larger projects. 
                            This provides me with the opportunity to truly express myself through my designs. At this 
                            Justin is just making up some jibberish to fill the space, but it is better than Lorem Ipsum
                            text right? Short sentences are good. Long sentences tend to change the way a piece of 
                            writing flows and could even alter the emotions given off. Medium sentences have a nice ring 
                            as well. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am not entirely sure what you would fill all this space with, but I will leave that to you
                            to figure out. After all, this is your website, so I shouldn't be the one writing it. The 
                            font size can also be made bigger so that you don't have to write as much. There is a happy 
                            medium somewhere between having enough information here but also not too much. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="row">

                        <p>
                            That section up there kind of has a lot of words. The more I build this, the less I am liking
                            the way this page looks. I think it is information overflow and just has too many words on it.
                            Maybe you can think of a better layout that would look a little nicer. I have tried so many
                            different ideas, but with learning how to do all this at the same time, it is pretty slow
                            moving. I need to get this done though so I am just putting things down for now. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You might not like this at all, and that is fine. Please be honest with me about it. Tell me it
                            sucks. I already know. Some of the simple things that I tried include: different backgrounds,
                            fonts (You probably won't like these, but that is fine I knew that when I chose them you are 
                            serious about your fonts), sizing parts different, and soooo much more.
                        </p>

                            I was thinking maybe part of this portion could be your inspirations. The images could also link
                            to pages about them. You can also mention Relay here or other things that you enjoy doing in your
                            free time because you have so much of that. Like I said above though, I really am growing to hate
                            this page. People won't read all this. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think this page needs a more 'modern' design. Something simplistic and minimal almost. Something
                            that sends a clear message but doesn't use words. How do you do that? Well I have no clue besides
                            it being some pretty confusing code, but I am learning slowly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My original idea was that the entire website would almost look like a sketch book hence the kinda
                            paper-ish background. I thought of making it bristol paper then making everything a more 
                            'handwriting' font, but I looked for an hour and couldn't really find a nice paper background. Also,
                            handwriting fonts aren't the most readable.

                        Here you could give a summary of your work, what work you want to be doing, all that kind of stuff.
                        Talk about what you are passionate about maybe and experiences you would like to gain. I don't know
                        exactly what you would say here, but it is your time to nerd out. Own it Emma.

                        <p>
                            The big thing with this section is to explain that the picture to the right links to your
                            portfolio page. There they can look at your portfolio duh and all that jazz. I am thinking
                            that your portfolio page could have a brief intro section, like a paragraph, about you and
                            what it contains. The cool part would be something like an 'e-portfolio' after the link to
                            download your portfolio. It would be the rest of the portfolio page and follow the same
                            order as your actual portfolio. With this, you might be able to provide more details than
                            what is in your portfolio or I don't really know what else. Each entry there would also link
                            to its project page where there would be MUCH more detail.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A project page would have concept -> sketches -> revisions -> rendering -> revisions -> 
                            final product. The entire process that you go through. The images below would actually be
                            changing with pictures of your projects and clicking them would take you to that specific 
                            project's page. Somewhere would also be a link to the general project page which has a 
                            brief summary for each alongside its picture (the one below) and link to the specific page.
